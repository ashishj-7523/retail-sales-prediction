# Rossmann Retail Sales Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict daily sales for Rossmann drug stores, a retail chain with over 3,000 stores across Europe. Accurate sales forecasts are crucial for effective business management, inventory planning, and marketing campaign optimization.

The project leverages historical sales data and additional store-related information to build a predictive model. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning techniques.
- EDA to understand data distribution, patterns, and relationships.
- Multiple machine learning models trained for sales prediction.
- Selection of the best-performing model (Random Forest) for deployment.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- xgboost (for XGBoost model)
- adaboost (for AdaBoost model)
